This will execute the script and produce the output, which should be a dictionary of specifications for the specified phone model.

This script uses the requests library to fetch the HTML content of the page, and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract the specifications data. The script defines a function get_phone_specifications that takes as input a phone model name and returns a dictionary of its specifications. In the example usage, we fetch the specifications for the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G and print the resulting dictionary.

Note that this script is just an example and may need to be modified to work for other phone models or other websites. Additionally, this script should be used with caution and respect for websites' terms of service and robots.txt files.
